// Compile the templates here once so they don't need to be compiled in every
// other file using them.
//
// Other files then include SophusUtil.h which contains extern template
// declarations to prevent compiling them there again. (For this reason,
// this header must not be included here).

// This section used to contain Eigen::Quaternion<float> and
// Eigen::Quaternion<double> template instantiations, but these were causing
// static assert falures on Clang.
